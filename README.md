JavaScript Demos
====================

These are just some small demos using JavaScript libraries and technology.

Notes
- The Google Maps and Bootstrap examples are self contained (css and JavaScript are called from CDN).
- The require JS library has some elements relative to the folder, as well as CDN use.
- Please do not add any demos that require running npm scripts.
