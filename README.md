JavaScript Demos
====================

These are just some small demos using Javascript libraries and technology.

Feel free to request new examples or code improvements via the issues functionality in GitHub.

Notes
- The Google Maps and Bootstrap examples are self contained (css and javascript are called from CDN).
- The require JS library has some elements relative to the folder, as well as CDN use.
